## Hi, I’m Zain 👋

I build applied machine learning systems that turn complex domain data
into reliable, decision-support tools.

### What I work on
- Hybrid ML systems combining rules, structured features, and probabilistic models
- Confidence-aware prediction pipelines (ranking, thresholds, decision bands)
- NLP + RAG systems grounded in curated knowledge bases
- Domain-specific AI for microbiology and laboratory workflows

### Featured Project — **BactAI-D**
An end-to-end microbiology phenotype identification system combining:

- Rule-based and schema-driven parsers
- Tri-fusion feature aggregation
- XGBoost genus-level prediction
- Confidence-gated decision logic
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for explainability
- Species-level scoring within predicted genera
- Has a Testing dataset comprised of ~8300 tests with over 300,000 total fields

Designed to be **transparent, auditable, and extensible**, with explicit
handling of uncertainty rather than forced predictions.

➡️ Live demo available via https://huggingface.co/spaces/EphAsad/BactAID-Demo
- Full architecture and training workflow documented in the repository

### Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- XGBoost, scikit-learn
- NLP, RAG, prompt engineering
- Structured parsing & feature engineering
- Model evaluation, calibration, and confidence design
- Git, GitHub, Hugging Face Spaces, Streamlit

### What I’m looking for
Applied ML / AI Engineering roles where correctness, interpretability,
and real-world constraints matter.

Open to international opportunities and visa sponsorship.
