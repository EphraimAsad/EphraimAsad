## Hi, I’m Zain 👋

I build **applied AI systems** that turn complex domain data into reliable, production-ready decision tools.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Applied Machine Learning
- Agentic AI workflows
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Domain-driven system design

I focus on building systems that are **transparent, auditable, and designed for real-world use**, especially in regulated or safety-critical environments.
